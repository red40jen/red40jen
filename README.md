### Hello there!

I'm really eager to learn more about embedded systems and development environments.  I'm starting this journey with what I believe are the fundamentals: learning to program in C and understanding computer architecture.  I am always happy to hear anybody's $0.02!

Little bit out me: I like skiing, jiu jitsu, yoga, and my guilty pleasures all contain red no. 40 :)
