HI there! My background is in physics and optical engineering.  I am currently part of a team that's working on developing free-space optical communications.  I'm looking to expand into embedded software, starting with what I believe are the fundamentals: learning to program in C and understanding computer architecture.  I am always happy to hear anybody's $0.02!
